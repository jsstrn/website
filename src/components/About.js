          I believe in delivering quality software through test driven
          development and clean code. I've developed both front and backend
          applications for over a decade and worked with clients from small
          startups to large enterprises.

          </a>{" "}
          and remain deeply involved in the tech community in Singapore. I also
          enjoy contributing to open source projects.

          When not programming, I like board games, yoga by the beach, and
          emojis.
